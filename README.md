2020 do-over - replace malloc with a basic fit-free list implementation in C.

Implementation goals:
1. Write a usable doubly linked list library in C
2. Implement basic "first-fit free list" malloc from https://embeddedartistry.com/blog/2017/02/15/implementing-malloc-first-fit-free-list/
3. Follow along the book [Modern C](https://modernc.gforge.inria.fr/) to writ good quality C (or, at least, better than my usual)
